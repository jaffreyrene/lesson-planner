This hook will explain to your viewers exactly what they're going to get if they stick
around to watch your video.
Why is this worth their precious time?
What do you have to give them that thousands of other creators don't?
Let's figure that out together as we explore the most pivotal element in short form video
content, the verbal hook.
This is a powerful direct to audience statement or question usually delivered in the first
person.
Now, I do want to preface that it doesn't actually mean you have to show your face.
We have a number of students with faceless channels that do an excellent job of delivering
a verbal hook with a voiceover.
We'll show you an example of that later in this lesson.
The verbal hook is used to immediately address the viewer and create a one-on-one conversation.
The effectiveness of this hook lies in its ability to clearly convey the value of your
video while igniting a flame of curiosity, all without revealing the final payoff.
Think of it as your video's opening handshake.
It sets the tone, builds a connection, and invites the viewer into your story, promising
them a rewarding experience for their time.
Crafting a verbal hook requires understanding your audience and the core message of your
video.
It should have curiosity, context, and clarity.
Think about what your audience is looking for and how your video fulfills that need.
The verbal hook should resonate with their interests, challenges, or curiosities.
Remember, your delivery is just as important as your words.
I cannot stress this enough.
Your tone, expression, and energy can enhance your hook's impact.
This might sound like overkill, but I like to have 5-10 different verbal hook options
that I can take into my edit so then I can pick which one sounds best.
I've pulled together some examples of powerful verbal hooks to share with you, and that way
you can see and hear exactly what I'm talking about.
Okay, I'm going to begin with this video that Glen and I shared on our TikTok channel
that got 11 million views.
Here's the hook I went with.
Apparently jackfruit can look and taste like pulled pork, so I'm going to try and trick
my husband.
This hook is surprisingly porky.
Now this video actually has 4 out of the 5 hooks that we talk about in this course, but
I feel like the verbal hook here is especially strong.
It is delivered in only 3 seconds, and from this very short hook, you are instantly introduced
to those 3 C's, starting with context.
From just one sentence spoken to the camera, you know exactly who and what is going to
be involved in this video.
In this case, it's a wife, her husband, and a jackfruit recipe.
You also have clarity of what the video is going to be about.
In this case, it's a wife pulling a prank on her husband.
And finally, it sparks your curiosity, because you now probably want to know what my husband's
reaction is going to be when he takes that first bite of this weird saucy barbecued fruit.
This is not to my own horn, but when it comes to the 3 C's, this was a slam dunk verbal
hook.
This verbal hook honestly probably could have done really well on its own, but I'm the type
of person who likes to cover all our bases, dot the i's, cross the t's, whatever that
is.
You'll notice in those first 3 seconds, I also included subtitles to reinforce that
verbal hook.
This is to further drive home what's to come, and great to include just in case people are
watching with low or no sound.
Which I think is crazy, like why are you watching with no sound?
The can of jackfruit that I'm holding is also a really great visual hook, because it provides
more clarity for those who might not know what jackfruit is.
It may leave them thinking, how the heck is that stuff going to turn into pulled pork?
And if all of that didn't hook them in, I also included, well that was unexpected, to
my caption, as a Hail Mary to try and spark curiosity and encourage people to stick it
through to the payoff at the end.
Let's look at another example from Connor's Golf Channel, where the verbal hook is delivered
a little bit differently.
This girl looks sporty.
Excuse me, do you golf?
What do you mean?
Like do you play golf?
Yes.
Do you want to play me right now?
Where?
Literally right across the street.
I don't have golf clubs.
I have some there for you.
Okay.
Okay.
By opening the video with an interview style conversation with a stranger, the viewer is
instantly intrigued as to what their response is going to be.
This is a phenomenal example of sparking curiosity with a verbal hook.
So many unanswered questions are subconsciously swimming through the viewer's head.
Who is the stranger?
Will the stranger accept the challenge?
Will they win?
With a quick back and forth, we are now hooked in to see how this all plays out.
It's really important to note that with this kind of a verbal hook, you are going to need
to rely on a text hook as well to give context as to where the video is going.
In this case, it's challenging strangers to golf.
If Connor posted the same video without that text hook, it probably would have only gotten
a few thousand views because people don't know why they should care about the interview
that's taking place.
Let's talk about if you're relying 100% on the verbal hook.
In this next example, I am literally standing in a boring boardroom talking to the camera.
Not a super intriguing visual by any means, but what I say in the first four seconds left
over a million people thinking, where is this video going?
My daughter has a phobia I've never heard of and it absolutely ruined our vacation.
And did it ever.
Now you're probably sitting on the other side of the screen right now wondering, what
the heck is the phobia?
Spiders?
Elevators?
Toothpaste?
With just 15 words, I've done my job of leaving you guessing and curious about what happened.
And I'm not even going to tell you right now because you can watch the video linked in
the lesson description.
But the point I want to drive home here is that I wasn't visually doing anything fancy.
Simply by delivering an unexpected statement directly to the camera, I was able to hook
those viewers in.
In hindsight, I may have actually filmed this in a bit of a more intriguing location or
had been doing something subliminal with my hands, which we will be talking about later.
But what can you do?
You live and you learn.
Something you may have noticed about all three of these verbal hooks is that they start within
the first millisecond of the video.
Leaving even just one or gosh forbid two seconds of blank space can immensely drop your watch
time.
Is a death sentence for your video and don't do it or I'm going to come over there and
re-edit it for you.
Now for an exercise.
Using either an existing video or an idea you have for a future video, write down ten
different variations of a verbal hook.
Try to make them all unique and play around with different lengths.
I find though that four to five seconds is the sweet spot.
And if you need a little help with your verbal hooks, remember that you can always post in
the Facebook group and get some feedback from our community.
Someone will help you out.
Maybe it'll be me.
Maybe it'll be Khan.
Maybe it'll be Glenn.
I don't know.
Moving on.
