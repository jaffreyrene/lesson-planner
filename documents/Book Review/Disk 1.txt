Blackstone audio presents the four-hour workweek escape nine-to-five live
anywhere and join the new rich by Timothy Ferris for my parents Donald and
Francis Ferris who taught a little hellion that marching to a different
drummer was a good thing I love you both and know you everything first and
foremost fact doubters read this is lifestyle design for you chances are
good that it is here are some of the most common doubts and fears that people
have before taking the leap and joining the new rich do I have to quit my job
do I have to be a risk-taker no on both counts from using Jedi mind tricks to
disappear from the office to designing businesses that finance your lifestyle
there are paths for every comfort level how does a fortune 500 employee explore
the hidden jewels of China for a month and use technology to cover his tracks
how do you create a hands-off business that generates $80,000 per month with no
management it's all here do I have to be a single 20 something not at all this
book is for anyone who is sick of the deferred life plan and wants to live
life large instead of postpone it case studies range from a Lamborghini
driving 21 year old to a single mother who traveled the world for five months
with her two children if you're sick of the standard menu of options and
prepared to enter a world of infinite options this book is for you do I have
I just want more time no it's just one option the objective is to create
freedom of time and place and use both however you want do I need to be born
rich no my parents have never made more than $50,000 per year combined and I've
worked since age 14 I'm no Rockefeller and you needn't be either do I need to
be an Ivy League graduate no most of the role models in this book didn't go
to the Harvard's of the world and summer dropouts top academic institutions are
wonderful but there are unrecognized benefits to not coming out of one grads
from top schools are funneled into high-income 80 hour per week jobs and 15
to 30 years of soul-crushing work has been accepted as the default path how do
I know I've been there and seen the destruction this book reverses it my
story and why you need this book whenever you find yourself on the side
of the majority it is time to pause and reflect Mark Twain anyone who lives
within their means suffers from a lack of imagination Oscar Wilde Irish
dramatist and novelist my hands were sweating again staring down at the floor
to avoid the blinding ceiling lights I was supposedly one of the best in the
world but it just didn't register my partner Alicia shifted from foot to foot
as we stood in line with nine other couples all chosen from over 1,000
competitors from 29 countries and four continents it was the last day of the
tango world championship semi-finals and this was our final run in front of
the judges television cameras and cheering crowds the other couples had an
average of 15 years together for us it was the culmination of five months of
non-stop six-hour practices and finally it was showtime how are you doing
Alicia a seasoned professional dancer asked me in her distinctly Argentine
fantastic awesome let's just enjoy the music forget the crowd they're not even
here that wasn't entirely true it was hard to even fathom 50,000 spectators and
coordinators in El Rural even if it was the biggest exhibition hall in Buenos
Aires through the thick haze of cigarette smoke you could barely make out the huge
undulating mass in the stands and everywhere there was exposed floor
except the sacred 30 by 40 foot space in the middle of it all I adjusted my pin
striped suit and fussed with my blue silk handkerchief until it was obvious
that I was just fidgeting are you nervous I'm not nervous I'm excited I'm just
going to have fun and let the rest follow number 152 Europe our chaperone
had done his job and now it was our turn I whispered an inside joke to Alicia as
we stepped on the hardwood platform tranquilo take it easy she laughed and at
just that moment I thought to myself what on earth would I be doing right now
if I hadn't left my job and the United States over a year ago the thought
vanished as quickly as it had appeared when the announcer came over the loud
speaker and the crowd erupted to match him pareja n√∫mero 152 Timothy Ferris
Alicia Monty's you dot the Buenos Aires we were on and I was beaming the most
fundamental of American questions is hard for me to answer these days and
luckily so if it weren't you wouldn't be holding this book in your hands so what
do you do assuming you can find me hard to do and depending on when you ask me
I'd prefer you didn't I could be racing motorcycles in Europe scuba diving off
a private island in Panama resting under a palm tree between kickboxing
sessions in Thailand or dancing tango in Buenos Aires the beauty is I'm not a
multimillionaire nor do I particularly care to be I never enjoyed answering
this cocktail question because it reflects an epidemic I was long part of
job descriptions as self descriptions if someone asks me now and is anything but
absolutely sincere I explain my lifestyle of mysterious means simply I'm
a drug dealer pretty much a conversation ender it's only half true besides the
whole truth would take too long how can I possibly explain that what I do with
my time and what I do for money are completely different things that I work
less than four hours per week and make more per month than I used to make in a
year for the first time I'm going to tell you the real story it involves a
quiet subculture of people called the new rich what does an igloo dwelling
millionaire do that a cubicle dweller doesn't follow an uncommon set of rules
how does a lifelong blue chip employee escape to travel the world for a month
without his boss even noticing he uses technology to hide the fact gold is
getting old the new rich nr are those who abandon the deferred life plan and
create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the new rich time
and mobility this is an art and a science we will refer to as lifestyle
design LD I've spent the last three years traveling among those who live in
worlds currently beyond your imagination rather than hating reality I'll show you
how to bend it to your will it's easier than it sounds my journey from grossly
overworked and severely underpaid office worker to member of the nr is at once
stranger than fiction and now that I've deciphered the code simple to duplicate
there is a recipe life doesn't have to be so damn hard it really doesn't most
people my past self included have spent too much time convincing themselves
that life has to be hard a resignation to nine to five drudgery in exchange for
sometimes relaxing weekends in the occasional keep it short or get fired
vacation the truth at least the truth I live and will share in this book is
quite different from leveraging currency differences to outsourcing your life and
disappearing I'll show you how a small underground uses economic sleight of
hand to do what most consider impossible if you've picked up this book chances are
that you don't want to sit behind a desk until you are 62 whether your dream is
escaping the rat race real-life fantasy travel long-term wandering setting world
records are simply a dramatic career change this book will give you all the
tools you need to make it a reality in the here and now instead of in the often
elusive retirement there is a way to get the rewards for a life of hard work
without waiting until the end how it begins with a simple distinction most
people miss one I missed for 25 years people don't want to be millionaires
they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy ski chalets
butlers and exotic travel often enter the picture perhaps rubbing cocoa butter
on your belly in a hammock while you listen to waves rhythmically lapping
against the deck of your thatched roof bungalow sounds nice one million dollars
in the bank isn't the fantasy the fantasy is the lifestyle of complete
freedom it supposedly allows the question is then how can one achieve the
millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom without first having one million
dollars in the last five years I have answered this question for myself and
this book will answer it for you I will show you exactly how I have separated
income from time and created my ideal lifestyle in the process traveling the
world and enjoying the best this planet has to offer how on earth did I go from
14 hour days and forty thousand dollars per year to four hour weeks and forty
thousand dollars per month it helps to know where it all started strangely
enough it was in a class of soon-to-be investment bankers in 2002 I was asked
by Ed Shao uber mentor and my former professor of high-tech entrepreneurship
at Princeton University to come back and speak to the same class about my
business adventures in the real world I was stuck there were already deca
millionaires speaking to the same class and even though I had built a highly
profitable sports supplement company I marched to a distinctly different drummer
over the ensuing days however I realized that everyone seemed to be discussing how
to build large and successful companies sell out and live the good life fair
enough the question no one really seemed to be asking or answering was why do it
all in the first place what is the pot of gold that justifies spending the best
years of your life hoping for happiness in the last the lectures I ultimately
developed titled drug dealing for fun and profit began with a simple premise
test the most basic assumptions of the work-life equation how do your decisions
change if retirement isn't an option what if you could use a mini retirement to
sample your deferred life plan reward before working 40 years for it is it
really necessary to work like a slave to live like a millionaire little did I know
where questions like these would take me the uncommon conclusion the common sense
rules of the real world are a fragile collection of socially reinforced
illusions this book will teach you how to see and seize the options others do not
what makes this book different first I'm not going to spend much time on the
problem I'm going to assume you are suffering from time famine creeping
dread or worst case a tolerable and comfortable existence doing something
unfulfilling the last is most common and most insidious second this book is not
about saving and will not recommend you abandon your daily glass of red wine for
a million dollars fifty years from now I'd rather have the wine I won't ask you
to choose between enjoyment today or money later I believe you can have both
now the goal is fun and profit third this book is not about finding your dream
job I will take as a given that for most people somewhere between six and seven
billion of them the perfect job is the one that takes the least time the vast
majority of people will never find a job that can be an unending source of
fulfillment so that is not the goal here to free time and automate income is I
open each class with an explanation of the singular importance of being a deal
maker the manifesto of the deal maker is simple reality is negotiable outside of
science and law all rules can be bent or broken and it doesn't require being
unethical the deal of deal making is also an acronym for the process of
becoming a member of the new rich the steps and strategies can be used with
incredible results whether you are an employee or an entrepreneur can you do
everything I've done with a boss no can you use the same principles to double
your income cut your hours in half or at least double the usual vacation time
most definitely here is the step-by-step process you'll use to reinvent yourself
D for definition turns misguided common sense upside down and introduces the
rules and objectives of the new game it replaces self-defeating assumptions and
explains concepts such as relative wealth and you stress uncommon terms are
defined throughout this book as concepts are introduced if something is unclear
or you need a quick reference please visit www.forourworkweek.com for an
extensive glossary and other resources who are the NR and how do they operate
this section explains the overall lifestyle design recipe the fundamentals
before we add the three ingredients E for elimination kills the obsolete notion
of time management once and for all it shows exactly how I use the words of an
often forgotten Italian economist to turn 12-hour days into two-hour days in
48 hours increase your per-hour results ten times or more with counterintuitive
NR techniques for cultivating selective ignorance developing a low information
diet and otherwise ignoring the unimportant this section provides the
first of the three luxury lifestyle design ingredients time a for
automation puts cash flow on autopilot using geographic arbitrage outsourcing
and rules of non-decision from bracketing to the routines of ultra
it's all here this section provides the second ingredient of luxury lifestyle
design income L for liberation is the mobile manifesto for the globally
inclined the concept of many retirements is introduced as are the means for
flawless remote control and escaping the boss liberation is not about cheap
travel it is about forever breaking the bonds that confine you to a single
location this section delivers the third and final ingredient for luxury
lifestyle design mobility I should note that most bosses are less than pleased
if you spend one hour in the office each day and employees should therefore read
the steps in the entrepreneurially minded deal order but implement them as
de la if you decide to remain in your current job it is necessary to create
freedom of location before you cut your work hours by 80% even if you have never
considered becoming an entrepreneur in the modern sense the deal process will
turn you into an entrepreneur in the purer sense as first coined by French
economist JB say in 1800 one who shifts economic resources out of an area of
lower and into an area of higher yield last but not least much of what I
recommend will seem impossible and even offensive to basic common sense I expect
that resolve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking if you
try it you'll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes and you won't ever go
back take a deep breath and let me show you my world and remember tranquilo
it's time to have fun and let the rest follow Tim Ferriss Tokyo Japan September
29th 2006 chronology of a pathology an expert is a person who has made all the
mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field Niels Bohr Danish
physicist and Nobel Prize winner ordinarily he was insane but he had
lucid moments when he was merely stupid Heinrich Heine German critic and poet

more than 30 world record holders actor on hit TV series in China and Hong Kong
TV host in Thailand and China political asylum researcher and activist shark
motorcycle racer how I got to this point is a tad less glamorous 1977 born six
weeks premature and given a 10% chance of living I survive instead and grow so
fat that I can't roll onto my stomach a muscular imbalance of the eyes makes me
look in opposite directions and my mother refers to me affectionately as
tuna fish so far so good 1983 nearly fail kindergarten because I
refused to learn the alphabet my teacher refuses to explain why I should learn
it opting instead for I'm the teacher that's why I tell her that's stupid and
ask her to leave me alone so I can focus on drawing sharks she sends me to the
bad table instead and makes me eat a bar of soap disdain for authority begins
1991 my first job are the memories I'm hired for minimum wage as the cleaner at
an ice cream parlor and quickly realized that the big bosses methods
duplicate effort I do it my way finish in one hour instead of eight and spend
the rest of the time reading kung fu magazines and practicing karate kicks
outside I am fired in a record three days left with the parting comment maybe
someday you'll understand the value of hard work it seems I still don't 1993 I
volunteer for a one-year exchange program in Japan where people work
themselves to death a phenomenon called karushi and are said to want to be
Shinto when born Christian when married and Buddhist when they die I conclude
that most people are really confused about life one evening intending to ask
my host mother to wake me the next morning okosu I asked her to violently
rape me okasu she's very confused 1996 I managed to slip undetected into
Princeton despite SAT scores 40% lower than the average and my high school
admissions counselor telling me to be more realistic I conclude I'm just not
good at reality I major in neuroscience and then switch to East Asian studies to
avoid putting printer jacks on cat heads 1997 millionaire time I create an audio
book called how I beat the Ivy League use all my money from three summer jobs
to manufacture 500 tapes and proceed to sell exactly none I will allow my mother
to throw them out only in 2006 just nine years of denial later such is the joy of
baseless overconfidence 1998 after four shot putters kick a friend's head in I
quit bouncing the highest paying job on campus and develop a speed reading
seminar I plaster campus with hundreds of god-awful neon green flyers that
read triple your reading speed in three hours and prototypical Princeton
students proceed to write bullshit on every single one I sell 32 spots at $50
each for the three-hour event and $533 per hour convinces me that finding a
market before designing a product is smarter than the reverse two months
later I'm bored to tears of speed reading and close-up shop I hate
services and need a product to ship fall 1998 a huge thesis dispute and the acute
fear of becoming an investment banker drive me to commit academic suicide and
inform the registrar that I am quitting school until further notice my dad is
convinced that I'll never go back and I'm convinced that my life is over my mom
thinks it's no big deal and that there is no need to be a drama queen spring
1999 in three months I accept and quit jobs as a curriculum designer at
Berlitz the world's largest publisher of foreign language materials and as an
analyst at a three-person political asylum research firm naturally I then
fly to Taiwan to create a gym chain out of thin air and get shut down by triads
Chinese mafia I returned to the United States defeated and decide to learn
kickboxing winning the national championship four weeks later with the
ugliest and most unorthodox style ever witnessed fall 2000 confidence restored
and thesis completely undone I returned to Princeton my life does not end and it
seems the year-long delay has worked out in my favor 20-somethings now have
David Koresh like abilities my friend sells a company for 450 million dollars
and I decide to head west to sunny California to make my billions despite
the hottest job market in the history of the world I managed to go jobless until
three months after graduation when I pull out my trump card and send one
32 consecutive emails he finally gives in and puts me in sales spring 2001 true
San networks has gone from a 15-person nobody to the number one privately held
data storage company how is that measured with 150 employees what are
they all doing I am ordered by a newly appointed sales director to start with a
in the phone book and dial for dollars I ask him in the most tactful way
possible why we are doing it like retards he says because I say so not a
good start fall 2001 after a year of 12 hour days I find out that I'm the
second lowest paid person in the company aside from the receptionist I resort to
aggressively surfing the web full-time one afternoon having run out of obscene
video clips to forward I investigate how hard it would be to start a dietary
supplement company turns out that you can outsource everything from
manufacturing to ad design two weeks and $5,000 of credit card debt later I have
my first batch in production and a live website good thing too as I'm fired
exactly one week later 2002 to 2003 brain quicken LLC has taken off and I'm
now making more than $40,000 per month instead of $40,000 per year the only
problem is that I hate life and now work 12 hour plus days seven days a week kind
of painted myself into a corner I take a one-week vacation to Florence Italy with
my family and spend ten hours a day in an internet cafe freaking out shit balls
I begin teaching Princeton students how to build successful ie profitable
companies winter 2004 the impossible happens and I'm approached by an
infomercial production company and an Israeli conglomerate huh interested in
buying my baby brain quicken I simplify eliminate and otherwise clean house to
make myself expendable miraculously BQ doesn't fall apart but both deals do back
to Groundhog Day soon thereafter both companies attempt to replicate my
product and lose millions of dollars June 2004 I decide that even if my
company implodes I need to escape before I go Howard Hughes I turn everything
upside down and backpack in hand go to JFK Airport in New York City buying the
first one-way ticket to Europe I can find I land in London and intend to
continue on to Spain for four weeks of recharging my batteries before returning
to the salt mines I start my relaxation by promptly having a nervous breakdown
the first morning July 2004 to 2005 four weeks turn into eight and I decide to
stay overseas indefinitely for a final exam in automation and experimental
living limiting email to one hour each Monday morning as soon as I remove
myself as a bottleneck profits increase 40% what on earth do you do when you no
longer have to work as an excuse to be hyperactive and avoid the big questions
be terrified and hold on to your ass with both hands apparently September 2006
I returned to the United States in an odd zen like state after methodically
destroying all of my assumptions about what can and cannot be done drug dealing
for fun and profit has evolved into a class on ideal lifestyle design the new
message is simple I've seen the promised land and there is good news you can have
at all step one D is for definition reality is merely an illusion albeit a
very persistent one Albert Einstein chapter one cautions and comparisons how
to burn 1 million dollars a night these individuals have riches just as we say
that we have a fever when really the fever has us Seneca for BC to AD 65 I
also have in mind that seemingly wealthy but most terribly impoverished class of
all who have accumulated dross but know not how to use it or get rid of it and
thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters Henry David Thoreau 1817
to 1862 1 a.m. Central Standard Time 30,000 feet over Las Vegas his friends
drunk to the point of speaking in tongues were asleep it was just the two
of us now in first class he extended his hand to introduce himself and an enormous
Looney Tunes enormous diamond ring appeared from the ether as his fingers
crossed under my reading light mark was a legitimate magnet he had at different
times run practically all the gas stations convenience stores and gambling
in South Carolina he confessed with a half smile that in an average trip to
Sin City he and his fellow weekend warriors might lose an average of 500,000
to 1 million dollars each nice he sat up in his seat as the conversation drifted
to my travels but I was more interested in his astounding record of printing
money so of all your businesses which did you like the most the answer took
less than a second of thought none of them he explained that he had spent more
than 30 years with people he didn't like to buy things he didn't need life had
become a succession of trophy wives he was on lucky number three expensive cars
and other empty bragging rights mark was one of the living dead this is exactly
where we don't want to end up apples and oranges a comparison so what makes the
difference what separates the new rich characterized by options from the
deferrer's D those who save it all for the end only to find that life has passed
them by it begins at the beginning the new rich can be separated from the crowd
based on their goals which reflect very distinct priorities and life
philosophies note how subtle differences in wording completely change the
necessary actions for fulfilling what at a glance appear to be similar goals
these are not limited to business owners even the first as I will show you later
applies to employees D to work for yourself and are to have others work
for you D to work when you want to and are to prevent work for work's sake and
to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect minimum effective load D to
early or young and are to distribute recovery periods and adventures many
retirements throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is
not the goal doing that which excites you is D to buy all the things you want
to have and are to do all the things you want to do and be all the things you
want to be if this includes some tools and gadgets so be it but they are either
means to an end or bonuses not the focus D to be the boss instead of the
employee to be in charge and are to be neither the boss nor the employee but
the owner to own the trains and have someone else ensure they run on time D
to make a ton of money and are to make a ton of money with specific reasons and
defined dreams to chase timelines and steps included what are you working for
D to have more and are to have more quality and less clutter to have huge
financial reserves but recognize that most material wants are justifications
for spending time on the things that don't really matter including buying
things and preparing to buy things you spent two weeks negotiating your new
infinity with the dealership and got ten thousand dollars off that's great does
your life have a purpose are you contributing anything useful to this
world or just shuffling papers banging on a keyboard and coming home to a
drunken existence on the weekends D to reach the big payoff whether IPO
acquisition retirement or other pot of gold and are to think big but ensure
payday comes every day cash flow first big payday second D to have freedom from
doing that which you dislike and are to have freedom from doing that which you
dislike but also the freedom and resolve to pursue your dreams without
reverting to work for works sake w4w after years of repetitive work you will
often need to dig hard to find your passions redefine your dreams and revive
hobbies that you let atrophy to near extinction the goal is not to simply
eliminate the bad which does nothing more than leave you with a vacuum but to
pursue and experience the best in the world
getting off the wrong train the first principle is that you must not fool
yourself and you are the easiest person to fool Richard P. Feynman Nobel Prize
winning physicist enough is enough lemmings no more the blind quest for cash
is a fool's errand I've chartered private planes over the Andes enjoyed many of
the best wines in the world in between world-class ski runs and lived like a
king lounging by the infinity pool of a private villa here's the little secret I
rarely tell it all costs less than rent in the United States if you can free
your time and location your money is automatically worth three to ten times
as much this has nothing to do with currency rates being financially rich and
having the ability to live like a millionaire are fundamentally two very
different things money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number
of W's you control in your life what you do when you do it where you do it and
with whom you do it I call this the freedom multiplier using this as our
criterion the 80 hour per week $500,000 per year investment banker is less
powerful than the employed and are who works a quarter of the hours for $40,000
but has complete freedom of when where and how to live the former's $500,000 may
be worth less than $40,000 and the latter's $40,000 worth more than $500,000
when we run the numbers and look at the lifestyle output of their money options
the ability to choose is real power this book is all about how to see and
create those options with the least effort and cost it just so happens
paradoxically that you can make more money a lot more money by doing half of
what you are doing now so who are the NR the employee who rearranges his
schedule and negotiates a remote work agreement to achieve 90% of the results
in one-tenth of the time which frees him to practice cross-country skiing and
take road trips with his family two weeks per month the business owner who
eliminates the least profitable customers and projects outsources all
operations entirely and travels the world collecting rare documents all
while working remotely on a website to showcase her own illustration work the
student who elects to risk it all which is nothing to establish an online video
rental service that delivers $5,000 per month in income from a small niche of
HDTV aficionados a two-hour-per-week side project that allows him to work full
time as an animal rights lobbyist the options are limitless but each path
begins with the same first step replacing assumptions to join the
movement you will need to learn a new lexicon and recalibrate direction using
a compass for an unusual world from inverting responsibility to
jettisoning the entire concept of success we need to change the rules new

2006 and he was now a mogul skiing gold medalist at the Turin Winter Olympics
unlike other full-time athletes he will never have to return to a dead-end job
after his moment of glory nor will he look back at this day as the climax of
his only passion after all he was only 21 years old and drove a black Lamborghini
born a Canadian and something of a late bloomer Dale found his calling an
internet-based IT company at the age of 13 fortunately he had a more experienced
mentor and partner to guide him his 15 year old brother Jason created to fund
their dreams of standing atop the Olympic podium it would only two years
later become the third largest company of its kind in the world while Dale's
teammates were hitting the slopes for extra sessions he was often buying sake
for clients in Tokyo in a world of work harder not smarter it came to pass that
his coaches felt he was spending too much time on his business and not enough
time in training despite his results rather than choose between his business
or his dream Dale chose to move laterally with both from either or to
both and he wasn't spending too much time on his business he and his brother
were spending too much time with the Canucks in 2002 they moved to the ski
capital of the world Australia where the team was smaller more flexible and
coached by a legend three short years later he received citizenship went head
to head against former teammates and became the third Aussie in history to
win winter gold in the land of wallabies and big surf Dale has since

times one two three so far so good in 12 hours they would all be back in Paris

of course New Caledonia nestled in the tropics of the Coral Sea New Caledonia

took them fifteen thousand miles around the world of course recouping their
initial investment had been part of the plan all said and done their fifteen
month exploration of the globe from the gondola rich waterways of Venice to the
tribal shores of Polynesia had cost between eighteen thousand dollars and
nineteen thousand dollars less than rent and baguettes in Paris most people would
consider this impossible then again most people don't know that more than three
hundred families set sail from France each year to do the same the trip had
been a dream for almost two decades relegated to the back of the line behind
an ever-growing list of responsibilities each passing moment brought a new list
of reasons for putting it off one day Julie realized that if she didn't do it

just continue to add up and make it harder to convince herself that escape
was possible one year of preparation and one thirty-day trial run with her
husband later they set sail on the trip of a lifetime Julie realized almost as
soon as the anchor lifted that far from being a reason not to travel and seek
adventure children are perhaps the best reason of all to do both pre-trip her
three little boys had fought like banshees at the drop of a hat in the
process of learning to coexist in a floating bedroom they learned patients
as much for themselves as for the sanity of their parents pre-trip books were
about as appealing as eating sand given the alternative of staring at a wall on
the open sea all three learned to love books pulling them out of school for one
academic year and exposing them to new environments had proven to be the best
investment in their education to date now sitting in the plane Julie looked out
at the clouds as the wing cut past them already thinking of their next plans to
find a place in the mountains and ski all year long using income from a sail
rigging workshop to fund the slopes and more travel now that she had done it
once she had the itch
chapter 2 rules that change the rules everything popular is wrong I can't give
you a surefire formula for success but I can give you a formula for failure try
to please everybody all the time Herbert Bayard Swope American editor and
journalist first recipient of the Pulitzer Prize everything popular is
wrong Oscar Wilde the importance of being earnest beating the game not
playing the game in 1999 sometime after quitting my second unfulfilling job and
eating peanut butter sandwiches for comfort I won the gold medal at the
Chinese kickboxing national championships it wasn't because I was
good at punching and kicking God forbid that seemed a bit dangerous considering
I did it on a dare and had four weeks of preparation besides I have a watermelon
head it's a big target I won by reading the rules and looking for loopholes of
which there were two one weigh-ins were the day prior to competition using
dehydration techniques I now teach to elite powerlifters I lost 28 pounds in
18 hours weighed in at 165 pounds and then hyper hydrated back to 193 pounds
most people will assume this type of weight manipulation is impossible so I've
provided sample photographs at www.4hourworkweek.com do not try this at
home I did it all under medical supervision it's hard to fight someone
from three weight classes above you poor little guys too there was a
technicality in the fine print if one combatant fell off the elevated
platform three times in a single round his opponent won by default I decided to
use this technicality as my single technique and just push people off as
you might imagine this did not make the judges the happiest Chinese I've ever
seen the result I won all of my matches by technical knockout TKO and went home
national champion something 99% of those with five to ten years of experience had
been unable to do challenging the status quo versus being stupid most people
walk down the street on their legs does that mean I walk down the street on my
hands do I wear my underwear outside of my pants in the name of being different
not usually no then again walking on my legs and keeping my thong on the inside
of work just fine thus far I don't fix it if it isn't broken different is
better when it is more effective or more fun if everyone is defining a problem or
solving it one way and the results are subpar this is the time to ask what if I
did the opposite don't follow a model that doesn't work if the recipe sucks it
doesn't matter how good a cook you are when I was in data storage sales my
first gig out of college I realized that most cold calls didn't get to the
intended person for one reason gatekeepers if I simply made all my
calls from 8 to 8 30 a.m. and 6 to 6 30 p.m. for a total of one hour I was able
to avoid secretaries and book more than twice as many meetings as the senior
sales executives who called from 9 to 5 in other words I got twice the results
for an eighth of the time from Japan to Monaco from globetrotting single mothers
to multi-millionaire race car drivers the basic rules of successful and are
are surprisingly uniform and predictably divergent from what the rest of the
world is doing the following rules are the fundamental differentiators to keep
in mind throughout this book one retirement is worst-case scenario
insurance retirement planning is like life insurance it should be viewed as
nothing more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case scenario in this
case becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of
capital to survive retirement as a goal or final redemption is flawed for at
least three solid reasons a it is predicated on the assumption that you
dislike what you are doing during the most physically capable years of your
life this is a non-starter nothing can justify that sacrifice B most people
will never be able to retire and maintain even a hot dogs for dinner
standard of living even 1 million is chump change in a world where traditional
retirement could span 30 years and inflation lowers your purchasing power
2 to 4 percent per year the math doesn't work the golden years become lower
middle-class life revisited that's a bittersweet ending see if the math does
work it means that you are one ambitious hard-working machine if that's the
case guess what one week into retirement you'll be so damn bored that you'll want
to stick bicycle spokes in your eyes you'll probably opt to look for a new
job or start another company kind of defeats the purpose of waiting doesn't
it I'm not saying I don't plan for the worst case I have maxed out 401ks and
IRAs I use primarily for tax purposes but don't mistake retirement for the
2 interest and energy are cyclical if I offered you 10 million dollars to work
24 hours a day for 15 years and then retire would you do it of course not you
couldn't it is unsustainable just as what most define as a career doing the same
thing for 8 plus hours per day until you break down or have enough cash to
permanently stop how else can my 30 year old friends all look like a cross
between Donald Trump and Joan Rivers it's horrendous premature aging fueled by
triple bypass frappuccinos and impossible workloads alternating periods
of activity and rest is necessary to survive let alone thrive capacity
interest and mental endurance all wax and wane plan accordingly the NR aims to
distribute many retirements throughout life instead of hoarding the recovery
and enjoyment for the fool's gold of retirement by working only when you are
most effective life is both more productive and more enjoyable it's the
perfect example of having your cake and eating it too personally I now aim for
one month of overseas relocation or high-intensity learning tango fighting
whatever for every two months of work projects 3 less is not laziness doing
less meaningless work so that you can focus on things of greater personal
importance is not laziness this is hard for most to accept because our culture
tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of personal productivity few
people choose to or are able to measure the results of their actions and thus
measure their contribution in time more time equals more self-worth and more
reinforcement from those above and around them the nr despite fewer hours
in the office produce more meaningful results than the next dozen non and are
combined let's define laziness anew to endure a non-ideal existence to let
circumstance or others decide life for you or to a massive fortune while
passing through life like a spectator from an office window the size of your
bank account doesn't change this nor does the number of hours you log in
handling unimportant email or minutiae focus on being productive instead of
busy for the timing is never right I once asked my mom how she decided when
to have her first child little old me the answer was simple it was something
we wanted and we decided there was no point in putting it off the timing is
never right to have a baby and so it is for all of the most important things the
timing always sucks waiting for a good time to quit your job the stars will
never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same
time the universe doesn't conspire against you but it doesn't go out of its
way to line up all the pins either conditions are never perfect someday is
a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you pro and con lists are
just as bad if it's important to you and you want to do it eventually just do it
and correct course along the way 5 ask for forgiveness not permission if it
isn't going to devastate those around you try it and then justify it people
whether parents partners or bosses deny things on an emotional basis that they
can learn to accept after the fact if the potential damage is moderate or in
any way reversible don't give people the chance to say no most people are fast to
stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you're
moving get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw
up 6 emphasize strengths don't fix weaknesses most people are good at a
handful of things and utterly miserable at most I am great at product creation
and marketing but terrible at most of the things that follow my body is
designed to lift heavy objects and throw them and that's it I ignored this for a
long time I tried swimming and looked like a drowning monkey I tried
basketball and looked like a caveman then I became a fighter and took off it
is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of
attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor the choice is between
multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement
fixing weaknesses that will at best become mediocre focus on better use of
your best weapons instead of constant repair 7 things in excess become their
opposite it is possible to have too much of a good thing in excess most
endeavors and possessions take on the characteristics of their opposite thus
pacifists become militants freedom fighters become tyrants blessings become
curses help becomes hindrance more becomes less too much too many and too
often of what you want becomes what you don't want this is true of possessions
and even time lifestyle design is thus not interested in creating an excess of
poisonous but the positive use of free time defined simply as doing what you
want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do 8 money alone is not the
solution there is much to be said for the power of money as currency I'm a fan
myself but adding more of it just isn't the answer as often as we'd like to
think in part it's laziness if only I had more money is the easiest way to
postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create
a life of enjoyment now and not later by using money as the scapegoat and work
as our all-consuming routine we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the
time to do otherwise John I'd love to talk about the gaping void I feel in my
life the hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I start my
computer in the morning but I have so much work to do I've got at least three
hours of unimportant email to reply to before calling the prospects who said no
yesterday gotta run busy yourself with the routine of the money wheel pretend
it's the fix-all and you artfully create a constant distraction that prevents you
from seeing just how pointless it is deep down you know it's all an illusion
but with everyone participating in the same game of make-believe it's easy to
forget the problem is more than money nine relative income is more important
than absolute income among dietitians and nutritionists there is some debate
over the value of a calorie is a calorie a calorie much like a rose is a rose is
fat loss as simple as expending more calories than you consume or is the
source of those calories important based on work with top athletes I know the
answer to be the latter what about income is a dollar is a dollar is a
dollar the new rich don't think so let's look at this like a fifth grade math
problem two hard-working chaps are headed toward each other chap a moving
at 80 hours per week and chap B moving at 10 hours per week they both make
fifty thousand dollars per year who will be richer when they pass in the middle
of the night if you said B you would be correct and this is the difference
between absolute and relative income absolute income is measured using one
holy and inalterable variable the raw and almighty dollar Jane Doe makes
$100,000 per year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe who makes $50,000 per
year relative income uses two variables the dollar and time usually hours the
whole per year concept is arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourself let's
look at the real trade Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year $2,000 for each of 50
weeks per year and works 80 hours per week Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour
John Doe makes $50,000 per year $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year but works
10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per hour in relative income John is four
times richer of course relative income has to add up to the minimum amount
necessary to actualize your goals if I make $100 per hour but only work one
hour per week it's going to be hard for me to run amok like a superstar
assuming that the total absolute income is where it needs to be to live my
dreams not an arbitrary point of comparison with the Jones's relative
income is the real measurement of wealth for the new rich the top new rich
mavericks make at least $5,000 per hour out of college I started at about $5 I'll
get you closer to the former 10 distress is bad you stress is good
unbeknownst to most fun-loving bipeds not all stress is bad indeed the new rich
don't aim to eliminate all stress not in the least there are two separate types
of stress each as different as euphoria and it's seldom mentioned opposite
dysphoria distress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker less
confident and less able destructive criticism abusive bosses and smashing
your face on a curb are examples of this these are things we want to avoid use
stress on the other hand is a word most of you have probably never heard you a
Greek prefix for healthy is used in the same sense in the word euphoria role
models who push us to exceed our limits physical training that removes our spare
tires and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of
you stress stress that is helpful and the stimulus for growth people who avoid
all criticism fail it's destructive criticism we need to avoid not
criticism in all forms similarly there is no progress without you stress and
the more you stress we can create or apply to our lives the sooner we can
actualize our dreams the trick is telling the two apart the new rich are
equally aggressive in removing distress and finding you stress Q&A questions and
actions one how has being realistic or responsible kept you from the life you
want to how has doing what you should resulted in subpar experiences or regret
for not having done something else three look at what you're currently doing and
ask yourself what would happen if I did the opposite of the people around me
what will I sacrifice if I continue on this track for five ten or twenty years

meaning was clear enough haul ass his sneakers gripped firmly on the jagged
rock and he drove his chest forward toward 3,000 feet of nothing he held his
breath on the final step and the panic drove him to near unconsciousness his
vision blurred at the edges closing to a single pinpoint of light and then he
floated the all-consuming celestial blue of the horizon hit his visual field an
instant after he realized that the thermal updraft had caught him and the
wings of the paraglider fear was behind him on the mountaintop and thousands of
feet above the resplendent green rainforest and pristine white beaches of
Copacabana Hans Keeling had seen the light that was Sunday on Monday Hans
returned to his law office in Century City Los Angeles is posh corporate haven
and promptly handed in his three-week notice for nearly five years he had
faced his alarm clock with the same dread I have to do this for another 40
to 45 years he had once slept under his desk at the office after a punishing
half-done project only to wake up and continue on at the next morning that
same morning he had made himself a promise two more times and I'm out of
here strike number three came the day before he left for his Brazilian
vacation we all make these promises to ourselves and Hans had done it before as
well but things were now somehow different he was different he had
realized something while arcing in slow circles toward the earth risks weren't
that scary once you took them his colleagues told him what he expected to
hear he was throwing it all away he was an attorney on his way to the top what
the hell did he want Hans didn't know exactly what he wanted but he had tasted
it on the other hand he did know what bored him to tears and he was done with
it no more passing days as the living dead no more dinners where his colleagues
compared cars riding on the sugar high of a new BMW purchase until someone
bought a more expensive Mercedes it was over immediately a strange shift began
Hans felt for the first time in a long time at peace with himself and what he
was doing he had always been terrified of plane turbulence as if he might die
with the best inside of him but now he could fly through a violent storm
sleeping like a baby strange indeed more than a year later he was still
getting unsolicited job offers from law firms but by then had started Nexus Surf
a premier surf adventure company based in the tropical paradise of Florianopolis
Brazil he had met his dream girl a karaoke with caramel colored skin
named Tatiana and spent most of his time relaxing under palm trees or treating
clients to the best times of their lives is this what he had been so afraid
of these days he often sees his former self in the underjoyed and overworked
professionals he takes out on the waves waiting for the swell the true emotions
come out God I wish I could do what you do his reply is always the same you can
the setting Sun reflects off the surface of the water providing a Zen like
setting for a message he knows is true it's not giving up to put your current
path on indefinite pause he could pick up his law career exactly where he left
off if he wanted to but that is the furthest thing from his mind as they
paddle back to shore after an awesome session his clients get a hold of
themselves and regain their composure they set foot on shore and reality sinks

British Prime Minister to do or not to do to try or not to try most people will
vote no whether they consider themselves brave or not uncertainty in
the prospect of failure can be very scary noises in the shadows most people
will choose on happiness over uncertainty for years I set goals made
resolutions to change direction and nothing came of either I was just as
insecure and scared as the rest of the world the simple solution came to me
accidentally four years ago at that time I had more money than I knew what to do
with I was making 70,000 or so per month and I was completely miserable
worse than ever I had no time and was working myself to death I had started my
own company only to realize it would be nearly impossible to sell oops I felt
trapped and stupid at the same time I should be able to figure this out I
thought why am I such an idiot why can't I make this work buckle up and stop
being such a insert expletive what's wrong with me the truth was nothing was
wrong with me I hadn't reached my limit I'd reached the limit of my business
model at the time it wasn't the driver it was the vehicle critical mistakes in
its infancy would never let me sell it I could hire magic elves and connect my
brain to a supercomputer it didn't matter my little baby had some serious birth
defects the question then became how do I free myself from this Frankenstein
while making itself sustaining how do I pry myself from the tentacles of
workaholism and the fear that it would fall to pieces without my 15-hour days
how do I escape this self-made prison a trip I decided a sabbatical year around
the world so I took the trip right well I'll get to that first I felt it prudent
to dance around with my shame embarrassment and anger for six months
all the while playing an endless loop of reasons why my cop-out fantasy trip
could never work one of my more productive periods for sure then one day
in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suffering would be I hit upon a
gem of an idea it was surely a highlight of my don't happy be worry phase why
don't I decide exactly what my nightmare would be the worst thing that could
possibly happen as a result of my trip well my business could fail while I'm
overseas for sure probably would a legal warning letter would accidentally not
get forwarded and I would get sued my business would be shut down an inventory
would spoil on the shelves while I'm picking my toes in solitary misery on
some cold shore in Ireland crying in the rain I imagine my bank account would
crater by 80% and certainly my car and motorcycle in storage would be stolen I
suppose someone would probably spit on my head from a high-rise balcony while
I'm feeding food scraps to a stray dog which would then spook and bite me
squarely on the face God life is a cruel hard bitch
conquering fear equals defining fear set aside a certain number of days during
which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare with coarse
and rough dress saying to yourself the while is this the condition that I
Then a funny thing happened in my undying quest to make myself
miserable I accidentally began to backpedal as soon as I cut through the
vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare the worst-case
scenario I wasn't as worried about taking a trip suddenly I started thinking
of simple steps I could take to salvage my remaining resources and get back on
track if all hell struck at once I could always take a temporary bartending job
to pay the rent if I had to I could sell some furniture and cut back on eating
out I could steal lunch money from the kindergarteners who passed by my
apartment every morning the options were many I realized it wouldn't be that hard
to get back to where I was let alone survive none of these things would be
fatal not even close mere panty pinches on the journey of life I realized that
on a scale of one to ten one being nothing and ten being permanently life
changing my so-called worst-case scenario might have a temporary impact
of three or four I believe this is true of most people and most would be holy
shit my life is over disasters keep in mind that this is the one in a million
disaster nightmare on the other hand if I realized my best-case scenario or even
a probable case scenario it would easily have a permanent nine or ten
positive life-changing effect in other words I was risking an unlikely and
temporary three or four for a probable and permanent nine or ten and I could
easily recover my baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I
wanted to this all equated to a significant realization there was
practically no risk only huge life-changing upside potential and I
could resume my previous course without any more effort than I was already
putting forth that is when I made the decision to take the trip and bought a
one-way ticket to Europe I started planning my adventures and eliminating my
physical and psychological baggage none of my disasters came to pass and my life
has been a near fairy tale since the business did better than ever and I
practically forgot about it as it financed my travels around the world in
style for 15 months uncovering fear disguised as optimism there's no
difference between a pessimist who says oh it's hopeless so don't bother doing
anything and an optimist who says don't bother doing anything it's going to turn
out fine anyway either way nothing happens Yvonne
Chouinard founder of Patagonia fear comes in many forms and we usually don't
call it by its four letter name fear itself is quite fear-inducing most
intelligent people in the world dress it up as something else optimistic denial
most who avoid quitting their jobs entertain the thought that their course
will improve with time or increases in income this seems valid and is attempting
hallucination when a job is boring or uninspiring instead of pure hell pure
hell forces action but anything less can be endured with enough clever
rationalization do you really think it will improve or is it wishful thinking
and an excuse for inaction if you were confident in improvement would you
really be questioning things so generally not this is fear of the
unknown disguised as optimism are you better off than you were one year ago
one month ago or one week ago if not things will not improve by
themselves if you are kidding yourself it is time to stop and plan for a jump

up 10 minutes later bad timing can spoil the fun Jean Marc Hachet landed in West
Africa as a volunteer with high hopes of lending a helping hand in that sense his
timing was great he arrived in Ghana in the early 1980s in the middle of a coup
d'etat at the peak of hyperinflation and just in time for the worst drought in a
decade for these same reasons some people would consider his timing quite
poor from a more selfish survival standpoint he had also missed the memo
the national menu had changed and they were out of luxuries like bread and
clean water he would be surviving for four months on a slush like concoction
of cornmeal and spinach not what most of us would order at the movie theater wow
I can survive Jean Marc had passed the point of no return but it didn't matter
after two weeks of adjusting to the breakfast lunch and dinner mush ala
Ghana he had no desire to escape the most basic of foods and good friends
proved to be the only real necessities and what would seem like a disaster from
the outside was the most life-affirming epiphany he'd ever experienced the worst
really wasn't that bad to enjoy life you don't need fancy nonsense but you do
need to control your time and realize that most things just aren't as serious
as you make them out to be now 48 Jean Marc lives in a nice home in Ontario but
could live without it he has cash but could fall into poverty tomorrow and it
wouldn't matter some of his fondest memories still include nothing but
friends and gruel he is dedicated to creating special moments for himself and
his family and is utterly unconcerned with retirement he's already lived 20

there is every reason not to Q&A questions and actions I am an old man
and have known a great many troubles but most of them never happened
Mark Twain if you are nervous about making the jump or simply putting it off
out of fear of the unknown here is your antidote write down your answers and
keep in mind that thinking a lot will not prove as fruitful or as prolific as
simply brain vomiting on the page write and do not edit aim for volume spend a
few minutes on each answer one define your nightmare the absolute worst that
could happen if you did what you are considering what doubts fears and what
ifs pop up as you consider the big changes you can or need to make envision
them in painstaking detail would it be the end of your life what would be the
permanent impact if any on a scale of one to ten are these things really
permanent how likely do you think it is that they would actually happen to what
steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing
even if temporarily chances are it's easier than you imagine how could you
get things back under control three what are the outcomes or benefits both
temporary and permanent of more probable scenarios now that you've defined the
what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes whether internal
confidence self-esteem etc. or external what would the impact of these more
likely outcomes be on a scale of one to ten how likely is it that you could
produce at least a moderately good outcome have less intelligent people
done this before and pulled it off if you were fired from your job today what
you do to get things under financial control imagine this scenario and run
through questions one through three above if you quit your job to test other
options how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely
had to five what are you putting off out of fear usually what we most fear doing
is what we most need to do that phone call that conversation whatever the
action might be it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing
what we need to do define the worst case accept it and do it I'll repeat
something you might consider tattooing on your forehead what we feared doing
most is usually what we most need to do as I have heard said a person's success
in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations
resolve to do one thing every day that you fear I got into this habit by
attempting to contact celebrities and famous business people for advice what
is it costing you financially emotionally and physically to postpone
action don't only evaluate the potential downside of action it is equally
important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction if you don't pursue those
things that excite you where will you be in one year five years and ten years how
will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you
and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you
know will not fulfill you if you telescope out ten years and know with
100% certainty that it is a path of disappointment and regret and if we
define risk as the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome inaction
is the greatest risk of all seven what are you waiting for if you cannot answer
this without resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing the
answer is simple you're afraid just like the rest of the world measure the cost
of inaction realize the unlikelihood and repair ability of most missteps and
develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so action
